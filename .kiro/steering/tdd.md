# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Follow strict TDD methodology for all code changes:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test first that describes the desired behavior
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

Reference: [Martin Fowler's TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html)
